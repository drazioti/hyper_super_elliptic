The repository contains sagemath files for solving hyperelliptic and superelliptic diophantine equations.<br/>
The algorithms are based on the paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.10754.pdf

**hyperelliptic.sage** concerns y^2=(x+a)(x+a+k)(x+b)(x+b+k)<br/>
**superelliptic.sage** concerns y^2=c^2x^4+ax^2+b<br/>
